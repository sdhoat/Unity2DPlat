Front to back connectivity: 
Load into the game either at a chosen start point (level system) or an essential start point with a start banner
The first part of the game will try to get the user to get to know the game and basic controls (jumping and abilities) 
The next part of the game will have the user participate under challenging jumps (moving platforms and longer jumps) and introduce an Asteroid as a new mechanic or transportation system.
The ending will be the problematic boss encounter of some sort that requires all mechanics.
